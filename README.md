# Runge-Kutta code in C++
This code integrates a partial or ordinary differential equation according to the Runge-Kutta method. The code is written in C++, for both the 4th and 3rd(coming soon) order method.

The code relies on you to conclude the functions to be integrated form the equations you have. You then simply insert them into the code and run.
Available to you also are the time variables and initial conditions to tamper according to your needs.

All the integration data will be saved in the data.csv file at the end.
